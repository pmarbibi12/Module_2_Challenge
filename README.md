# VBA-challenge

stockCalc.bas can be imported and used in both the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm and in alphabetical_testing.xlsx

sotckCalc-Alphabetical.bas is the exact same code and can also be used in both spreadhseets to get the desired results.

Included are screenshots of the results using the vba code. I labled the bottom results with _bottom.
